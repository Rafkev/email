Email newsletter created using HTML with external CSS
This email newsletter is created using HTML with external CSS. Keep in mind that when creating HTML email templates, it's important to use inline styles as much as possible to ensure better compatibility across different email clients.
In this example, we have an HTML structure for the email newsletter with a header, content, and footer sections. The styles for the header, content, and footer are defined in an external CSS file named styles.css.

When sending the email newsletter, remember to inline the CSS styles to ensure better compatibility with various email clients. You can use tools like Mailchimp, Litmus, or an online CSS inliner to inline your styles before sending the email.
